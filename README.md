Library polyclip-go is a pure Go, MIT-licensed implementation of an [algorithm for Boolean operations on 2D polygons][fmartin] (invented by F. Mart√≠nez, A.J. Rueda, F.R. Feito) -- that is, for calculation of polygon intersection, union, difference and xor.

The original paper describes the algorithm as performing in time _O((n+k) log n)_, where _n_ is number of all edges of all polygons in operation, and _k_ is number of intersections of all polygon edges.

## Limitations

- Although the algorithm will not produce self-intersecting polygons, it is not designed
  to handle them either. The behavior of the library is undefined if it is given
  self-intersecting polygons. This includes the scenarios in
  https://github.com/akavel/polyclip-go/issues/3.

## Example

Simplest Go program using polyclip-go for calculating intersection of a square and triangle:

    // example.go
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "github.com/akavel/polyclip-go" // or: bitbucket.org/...
    )

    func main() {
        subject := polyclip.Polygon{{{1, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 2}, {2, 1}}} // small square
        clipping := polyclip.Polygon{{{0, 0}, {0, 3}, {3, 0}}}        // overlapping triangle
        result := subject.Construct(polyclip.INTERSECTION, clipping)

        // will print triangle: [[{1 1} {1 2} {2 1}]]
        fmt.Println(result)
    }

To compile and run the program above, execute the usual sequence of commands:

    go get github.com/akavel/polyclip-go  # or: bitbucket.org/...
    go build example.go
    ./example      # Windows: example.exe
